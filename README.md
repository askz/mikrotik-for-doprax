# Mikrotik RouterOS in Docker


This project comprises a Docker image that runs a MikroTik's RouterOS virtual machine inside QEMU.

It's designed to simulate MikroTik's RouterOS environment, making it an excellent tool for development and testing purposes, especially for those working with the RouterOS API.

This Docker image is particularly useful for unit testing the routeros-api-php library, allowing developers to test applications in a controlled environment that closely mimics a real RouterOS setup.

For users seeking a fully operational RouterOS environment for production use within Docker, the VR Network Lab project is recommended as an alternative.

When deployed, just login with "admin" and no password, you will then be prompted to change the password.
